        <h3>Words from Staff and Members</h3>
        <br>
        <h5>Mentor</h5> 
        <p>Hello all staff and members! This past year, Project Melody grew so fast and made a very big impact on our community. Thank you to all the members and performers that helped make it happen! Everyone did a great job and we look forward to having another great year! <br> In 2023 We would encourage everyone to focus on community services, actively participating in all kinds of ACAN events, and senior home performances. We hope everyone will
          <ul>
            <li>be proud of being a member</li>
            <li>be proud of working together</li>
            <li>be proud of serving our community</li>
          </ul></p>
        <h5>Adriana</h5>
        <p>Hello everybody! Thank you so much for becoming a member of Project Melody. It has been a great year working with you guys. I am so glad that I have had the privilege to see this community grow as we have fun while serving our community. I can’t wait for the upcoming year and for more opportunities to get together and spread the love of music. Happy new year and enjoy 2023!</p>
        <h5>Evelyn</h5>
        <p>I wanted to thank everyone for joining Project Melody. We’ve had our challenges throughout the year, but working together as this amazing community has allowed us to grow as we spread music to people all over the city. I’m excited to help the project progress as we try to expand it to hopefully be able to perform for more demographics, as well as have more events and cool music-related endeavors in the future!</p>
        <h5>Dalton</h5>
        <p>Hello everyone! It has been really amazing working with you all for the past year. 2022 was a tough year for Project Melody, as it was Project Melody's first year of existence, but with your help and hard work, we made it happen. I would like to thank our amazing staff and our mentors helping us with logistical issues, as well as the Austin Chinese American Network, or ACAN, for providing us with the funds necessary for the functioning of Project Melody. I would also like to thank all of YOU, the members, who spent your time practicing and preparing for concerts. I wish everyone a happy New Year and an amazing 2023! </p>

        <h5>Iris</h5>
        <p>I am so grateful to be able to play with musicians in the community and share the music to others at the same time. Thank you for being part of the Project Melody! I've been able to make so many new friends and grow both as a person and a musician, too. I hope this new year we are able to find others who are interested in music and be able to give them a chance to show who they are through music as well as have more amazing concerts with amazing music!</p>
        <h5>Aiden</h5>
        <p>I’m really proud and supportive that Project Melody continues to grow as a blossoming organization in our community. It’s beginning to become a defining characteristic, and really something to be proud of, in our city. I hope that as time goes on, I’ll be able to tell all my out of state friends about Project Melody while they jealously listen, wishing that we were to expand and create such a branch in their community. <br> I especially felt that sort of “friendship pride” when Dalton conducted the Project Melody orchestra. </p>
